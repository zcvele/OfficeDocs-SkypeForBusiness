# Usage reports in the Teams Management Pro portal

There are reports for health and usage that are available in the **Reporting** node in the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. The **Reporting** node contains data for the health and usage of your Microsoft Teams Rooms in the Pro Management portal. The **Overview** tab surfaces tenant-wide health trends of your rooms. The **Health** tab displays a list of rooms with their corresponding health data. Room usage based on calendar information and call quality data is visible under the **Usage** tab.

## Export tickets

The ticket export feature lets you export all active and closed ticket history information within a select date range. Exporting tickets lets you easily access and analyze your ticket history data for better decision making.  

Under the **Overview** report, the **Export tickets** button provides ticket history details that include the following fields: creation date, device name, incident type, ticket state, ticket, last update, history, last resolved date, message/notes conversations, closure summary, closed by, and last closed date. 

The data is generated in a JSON file that you can download and import into Power BI. The download starts after you select **Export tickets**. If you leave the portal before the download starts, you have to request the file again.

Ex: Time period set to seven days in the report. The room was booked for five days during that period and the total hours= (8 * *5) =* 40 hours*. **In this case, utilization = (8 **** **5)/ (7 * 8) = 40/56= 71%**      |

## Usage details of a room

Clicking on a room in the list view prompts a flyout with more in-depth information. Under the Utilization tab of the flyout is a graph showing hours of usage of the last five business days. For each day there are two bars: blue represents booked meeting time; purple represents scheduled time of Teams/Skype enabled meetings. At the bottom, the average meeting bookings and duration for the past five business days are calculated.

<!--![A screenshot of utilization by hours per day](../media/health-and-usage-012.png)-->
