# Managing Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows Devices Using Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal

In the Teams Rooms Pro management portal, you can configure application settings for individual Teams Rooms on Windows devices, provided you have the necessary role-based access control permissions for Rooms Management. For more information, see [role-based access control in the Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-pro-rbac).

## How it works

Teams Rooms devices have application settings that can either be applied on the device and synchronized with the Teams Rooms Pro management portal, or applied from the Teams Rooms Pro management portal to the device.

In the Teams Rooms Pro management portal, certain Teams Rooms application settings can be changed from the **Rooms detail settings** pane. Applying these changes require restarting the Teams Rooms application on the device to apply the setting change.

The Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows application uses a SkypeSettings.XML configuration file to manage application settings on the device. When settings are changed on the device, a synchronization task updates the Teams Rooms Pro management portal settings for that device.

> [!Note]
> Synchronization may take up to 15 minutes to reflect the changes.

## Changing settings

After changing a setting and pressing the **Apply** button, a dialog box will present two options:

- **Apply Now** - Queues a job to apply the setting and restarts the device as soon as possible to apply the setting changes. This process can take several minutes. A banner is displayed to indicate that a settings change has been initiated, along with the number of settings changes jobs that are queued. 
- **Schedule Later** - Schedules the settings change to be applied during the nightly maintenance window to avoid disrupting scheduled meetings during business hours.

> [!Note]
> The **Apply Now** option won't be available for devices actively in use.

## Settings job history

Since setting changes from the Teams Rooms Pro management portal to the Teams Rooms device aren't in real-time, there will be a delay. An indicator is visible next to any setting that is pending a change or pending verification of a change as a visual cue that a job is in progress for that device.

To provide visibility to the Teams Rooms Pro management technician, there's a **Settings Job History** activity under the **Activity** tab on the Rooms detail panel. This indicates the stage of settings change.

An entry is made for every setting change initiated by a user or by the Teams Rooms Pro management service.

|**Field name**|**Description**|
|:------|:------|
|Status|Indicates the stat of the settings job.|
|Submitted on|Indicates the timestamp of the status of the job.|
|Submitted by|Indicates the individual who initiated the settings change or the Teams Rooms Pro Managed Rooms Service|
|Completed on|Indicates that timestamp when the job completed.|

### Device settings job history detail

By selecting the **Settings Job history** row in the table, a **Device settings** job panel is displayed with details about the specific device setting changes.

|**Field name**|**Description** |
|:------|:------|
|Job ID|A unique ID assigned to the settings job.|
|Status|Contains one of the following values: Submitted, Running, Completed, Completed with errors, Canceled, or Failed.|
