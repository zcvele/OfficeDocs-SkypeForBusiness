In Microsoft Teams, your users can record and transcribe their meetings, events, and calls. Transcription automatically turns spoken dialogue into written text, making it easy to review or share key discussions later. Recording captures audio, video, and screen-sharing activities, allowing users to revisit or share the full meeting experience as needed. The user's ability to manage the recording of their meetings and calls is referred to as convenience recording. To understand the different types of recordings in Teams, see [Introduction to recording Microsoft Teams calls and meetings](teams-recording-policy.md).

As an admin, you can manage convenience recording and transcription for meetings and calls in your organization through policy settings.

## Meeting and calling policies

Teams meeting policies control the user permissions for recording and transcription in meetings, events, and group calls, while Teams voice calling policies control the same permissions, but for 1:1 calls. 1:1 calls include both internal and external native Teams calls and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) calls. If your users use both Teams meetings and Teams calls, it’s important to consider matching the policy settings for both meeting and calling scenarios.

For example, let’s say your organization’s finance team shouldn’t record or transcribe calls and meetings. You turn off recording and transcription in the calling policy and assign it to users in the finance team. However, because you didn’t update or assign a specific meeting policy to those users, their meeting settings default to the global policy, where recording and transcription for meetings and group calls are on by default. This means that although the finance team can't record or transcribe 1:1 calls, they can still record and transcribe meetings and group calls because you didn't create and assign a custom meeting policy to them. For consistent recording and transcription settings across both meetings and 1:1 calls, it’s important to configure and assign both meeting and calling policies appropriately.

To learn more about assigning policies to both users and groups in your organization, see [Assign policies to users and groups](assign-policies-users-and-groups.md).

The following sections outline the policy settings and features you can use to manage recording and transcription in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> When you make changes to the Global policy, they apply to everyone in your organization, except for users with an assigned custom meeting or calling policy.
